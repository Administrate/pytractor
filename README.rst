**Angular.js for the testing goat: Utilities for testing Angular.js applications with Selenium for Python.**

Overview
--------

*pytractor* is an extension to the `Selenium bindings for Python <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium>`_. Its goal is to make testing of angular.js applications easier with Python.

It is built on some parts of `protractor <https://github.com/angular/protractor>`_, the "official" Javascript E2E/Scenario testing framework for Angular.js.
